I've always been fascinated by reinforcement learning, and after working with it in simulation, I decided I wanted to bring it to the physical world. Thus, I took inspiration from one of the classic RL environments - acrobot. It's a simple double pendulum, but sophisticated enough to be a challenge to implement. It is powered by a stepper motor that applies torque to the first link in the pendulum, and the agent is rewarded on the height of the end of the second arm.
