#June 5: research into cartpole!
The main motivation for this project comes from wanting to bring RL into the physical world. I've trained in simulations before, but I want to build a desktop model.

Did a lot of research into parts, how motors work, stepper vs servo vs brushless (still a bit confused, this is my first real hardware project.)

Belt system to move cart (probably some kind of stepper motor with a rail?)

Pendulum system (probably going to start with single pendulum for training)

Want to recreate something like this. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ce6fd69-1008-45c2-aaab-156578da629d)
